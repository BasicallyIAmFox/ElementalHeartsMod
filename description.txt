1.1
	All pre-hardmode hearts finished.
	First release on the mod browser.
	(From here, I am going to make sure everything within the code and mod that I want is finished before comensing to Hardmode / Bosses. Im going to work on some UI etc.)

1.0
	A complete rewrite of the old 1.3 classic. New repo, same mod. Drastically changing the codebase, incorporating a WAY more modular design with functionality and scalability in mind. Void of the numerous bugs that plagued the old mod, you guys know what I'm referencing.
